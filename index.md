# About

I have 14 years experience in digital marketing and primarily within SEO. I have worked at large global agencies in both London and Stockholm. Most recently I co-founded and helped build a digital marketing agency in Stockholm, wearing hats ranging from SEO consultant to COO.

As an independent consultant I work both hands-on and at an operational level depending on what your business needs. I work to understand your business and how SEO fits within the marketing strategy as a whole to ensure that time and resources are not used on initiatives that don’t drive business value.

I prefer work as an embedded in-house consultant so all stakeholders gain as much value as possible. I can work on-site with clients based in the Stockholm area.
